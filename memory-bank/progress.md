# Project Progress: Car Finder

## 1. Current Status

**Phase:** Project Initialization

The project is in its initial setup phase. The foundational documentation has been created, but no application code has been written or modified yet. The repository appears to contain a significant amount of boilerplate or pre-existing code that has not yet been reviewed.

## 2. What Works

- **Documentation:** The `memory-bank/` directory and its core files are now in place.
- **Scraper Foundation:** The `packages/scraper` service has been created and initialized with Crawlee. It is integrated into the monorepo, and its dependencies are installed. A basic crawler entry point exists at `packages/scraper/src/main.ts`.

## 3. What's Left to Build

Everything. The core features of the "Car Finder" application need to be designed, implemented, and tested. Key areas include:

- **User Authentication:** A system for users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts.
- **Car Listings:** Functionality for creating, viewing, updating, and deleting car listings.
- **Search & Filtering:** A comprehensive search feature.
- **Database Schema:** The database schema in `packages/drizzle/src/db/schema.ts` needs to be defined.
- **API Endpoints:** The tRPC routers need to be implemented to support the frontend features.
- **UI Implementation:** The React components and views need to be built.
- **Scraping Service:** The foundational service exists. The next steps are to develop specific crawlers for target websites and integrate the scraped data with the database.

## 4. Known Issues

- None at this time.

## 5. Project Evolution & Decisions

- **Decision (Initial):** A `memory-bank/` documentation system has been adopted to ensure project continuity and clarity.

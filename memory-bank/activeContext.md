# Active Context: Car Finder

## 1. Current Focus

The current focus is to fully integrate the new core requirement of a web scraping service into the project's documentation and overall plan.

## 2. Recent Changes

- **Finalized Scraping Technology:** After a detailed discussion, **Crawlee** has been selected as the official framework for the web scraping service. This decision is based on its resource efficiency, low maintenance, and suitability for the project's specific needs.
- **Updated Core Documents:** All relevant Memory Bank files (`systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`) have been updated to reflect the choice of Crawlee.

## 3. Next Steps

- Formulate a concrete development plan to create the new `packages/scraper` service using Crawlee.
- Begin implementation.

## 4. Active Decisions & Considerations

- The initial documentation is based on inferences from the project's file structure. It will need to be validated and refined as development progresses.
